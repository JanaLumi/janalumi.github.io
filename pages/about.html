My work explores how systems of design—whether digital, institutional, or conceptual—shape and constrain the conditions of participation. I’m particularly drawn to the edges: to recursive processes that either erode or reinforce boundaries, to loops that both enclose and open. In this space, I use code, mathematics, and speculative interfaces not only as tools but as provocations—asking how computation might be felt, how logic might be unsettled by affect, and how digital rituals might recover something lost to abstraction.

I’m interested in the quiet exclusions that emerge from what is assumed to be neutral or universal: the expectation of certainty, the scheduling of time, the narrowing of access through aesthetic, cultural, or procedural codes. Serendipity—once a source of wonder and encounter—is often eliminated through the very mechanisms designed to make participation possible. There is no such thing as a disembodied voice; only the persistence of a delusion that some bodies speak from nowhere while others are too loud, too strange, too much.

Within this network, I approach posthumanism as a boundary object—not a fixed doctrine, but a shared inquiry into what it might mean, what it might not mean, and what lives between and beyond. I’m drawn to the possibility that this space can challenge the academic architectures that harden around certainty, framing inclusion through rigid forms of legibility. I wonder instead: how might we design for porousness, for unfinishedness—for the kinds of encounters that leave us changed?
